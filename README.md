# Complaints-Management-System

Students' complaints over a recently released version of coursework or exam marks are usually handled by filling a 'complaints form'.
They then have to move to and fro the offices to check out the progess of the complaints.
This is tedious, tiresome and time wasting.
This is a solution that saves the time, and continous moements to offices as a student now gets updated of whether their complaint has been submitted, reviewed, or even resolved.
It is very scalable and material saving as no paperwork and bulk files have to be stored.
